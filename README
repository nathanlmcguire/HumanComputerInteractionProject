INTRUCTIONS:

1) Download the contents of the "Project Folder" zipped folder.
2) Use the "HCI Prototype" exe file within that folder.
3) Intructions will be provided on screen when it comes to using the application.

SUMMARY: My prototype is part of testing how much a user working on a task is distracted by notifications. 

NOTE: When you enter answers into the input field, it does not show the number you typed.  This is something that I am working on, however, THE PROTOTYPE DOES WORK!
This is a minor issue that will be fixed.  Please enter your answers as usual.
