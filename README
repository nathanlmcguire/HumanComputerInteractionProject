INTRUCTIONS:

1) Enter the "Project Folder" folder.
2) Use the "HCI Prototype" exe file.
3) Intructions will be provided on screen when it comes to using the application.

SUMMARY: My prototype is part of testing how much a user working on a task is distracted by notifications. 

NOTE: When you enter answers into the input field, it does not show the number you typed.  This is something that I am working on, however, THE PROTOTYPE DOES WORK!
This is a minor issue that will be fixed.  Please enter your answers as usual.
